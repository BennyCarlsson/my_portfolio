    <p>So people actually read this?</p>
    <p>So the app follow me home that I created uses the gps and wifi on your phone to get your gps coordinates. This coordinates is then sent to the server so it can be sent to
      the person you sharing your position with using google cloud messaging.</p> <p>For the moment I don't save any coordinates in the database only the information of who is following who
        and some other user data like when you registered and stuff like that</p>
